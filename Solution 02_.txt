Difference between Absolute and Relative positioning.

1.Reference Point:

Absolute: Positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block.
Relative: Positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.


2.Impact on Layout:

Absolute: Does not affect the layout of other elements.
Relative: Affects the layout of other elements as it still occupies space in the document flow.


3.Document Flow:

Absolute: Taken out of the normal document flow.
Relative: Positioned within the normal document flow.


4.Usage:

Absolute: Useful for precise positioning without affecting surrounding elements.
Relative: Used when you want to adjust an element's position without removing it from the document flow.


5.Ancestor Dependency:

Absolute: Positioned relative to the closest positioned ancestor.
Relative: Positioned relative to its own layout space, but can be influenced by ancestor positioning.
